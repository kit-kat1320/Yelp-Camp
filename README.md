# Yelp-Camp

YelpCamp is a website where users can create campgrounds and add photos, leave reviews, and use the maps to find campgrounds in specific areas. You must have an account to leave a review! This project was part of Colt Steele's web dev course on udemy.  

This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.  

## Features
* Users can create, edit, and remove campgrounds.
* Users can review campgrounds and edit or remove their review. Each review is only editable by the person who created it. 
* User profiles include more information on the user (full name, email, phone, join date), their campgrounds, and the option to edit their profile or delete their account.
* Search campground by name or location
* Sort campgrounds by highest rating, most reviewed, lowest price, or highest price.
